Ragged and chaotic graphics, machine-made sculptures and high video production value — why did these works, so dissimilar, end up together in a small gallery space? Why do they even constitute the practice of a single artist? Production Failure is a personal exhibition of new works by Irina Petrakova, in which human and animal, man-made and natural, verified and random collide and make contact.
<br><br>
In the storm of oil paint in Petrakova’s graphic works, parts of human bodies, animal claws or fishtails rush by now and then. This whirlwind of recognisable images, abstract bodily masses and deliberately careless strokes reveals a transitional state between figurativeness and abstraction, in which neither representation nor interpretation plays a decisive role. In works on canvas and small graphic sheets, a special moment of failure of the visual image is captured. This error of reproduction was made intentionally by the artist: both as a way of bringing to life a different reality and as documentation of a new stage in the development of the physical.
<br><br>
In two new sculptures from the Broiler-pass series — realised in a 3D printing technique unusual for the artist — the exploration of the borderline continues, and the images of the human and the animal converge again. However, unlike graphics, this contradictory union is not achieved in a hurricane, and the point of convergence of the human, animal and machine is easy to determine. But even with all the apparent precision, it is difficult for us to choose the side of figurativeness or abstraction — it is equally impossible to accept and reject the reality of the forms created by Petrakova. As if generated by a printer software glitch, the sculptures are the creations of another world, indistinguishable from ours in the recent past.
<br><br>
The liminal space returns in the video that concludes the exhibition, where it becomes dynamic: observing the oscillation between the images of man and beast. Over time, the heroine with increased intensity discovers her animal nature — the “defect of production” makes itself felt again, this time in a specific living organism.
<br><br>
The graphic works, sculptures and videos at the exhibition at the Iragui gallery — with all their contrasts and similarities — reveal to us not only the essence of the practice but also the personality of the artist Irina Petrakova. A hurricane of ideas, strokes, connections, and inconsistencies, images that came to life and were immediately crossed out. Only for a fraction of a second does a glitch occur and the moment is recorded, but the the storm itself never ends.
