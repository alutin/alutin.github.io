<div class="inside-container">
<div class="inside-text">Nikolay Alutin is an independent curator, researcher and (occasional) writer.
<br><br>
His theoretical research is concerned with art institutions in the process of implementing structural change and explores various roles both organisations and practitioners can adopt in policy-making for the cultural sector. His curatorial practice is focused on instabilities that allow for systemic alterations to take place within the art system and socio-political landscapes at large.
<br><br>
He has organised exhibitions in museums and art spaces independently and occasionally in collaboration with institutions such as Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, the Moscow Museum of Modern Art (MMOMA), the National Centre for Contemporary Arts Moscow, the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts and Spike Art Berlin, among others.
<br><br>
Nikolay Alutin holds an MA in Art History from the Russian State University for the Humanities, an MA in Languages of Mass Communication from the Ural Federal University. He currently lives and works in Amsterdam after participating in the 2018 Curatorial Programme at De Appel and joining the institution's team as the Curatorial Research Fellow in 2019â€”2020.
